# Demo-Repo-for-Buildables

A demo repo for the Buildables task, learning Git and GitHub

## Task Description

In this task, I explored the basics of Git and GitHub, understood their differences, and learned why version control is essential in software development.  
I also practiced using some core Git commands that help manage a GitHub repository directly from the local machine.
